# Indiranagar ka Gunda

This is the solution to a problem given to me by @exagil.

The problem is as follows:

Chirag is [Indiranagar ka Gunda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im8-ymK-T_Y), but somehow,
he finds himself having dinner with Kaustubh and Aditya at a restaurant in JP Nagar. He wants
to go back to Indiranagar but he can take one of several ways back home. He has the information
about the traffic and some black box formula to determine the amount of time it will take to go
from a point A to point B in Bangalore. He gives this information to Kaustubh and Aditya and asks
them to tell him the best route to go back to Indiranagar.

# To try it out
```shell
go run main.go times.csv jpnagar indiranagar
```
